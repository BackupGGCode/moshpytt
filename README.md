#moshPyTT
moshPyTT is a program to open and display [Tesseract](http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) training files (image and boxfile) side by side to allow the boxfiles to be corrected. This is a vital step in training Tesseract to new text.

It is written using [Python](http://python.org) and [PyGTK](http://pygtk.org), so it can be run on different platforms.

It is loosely based on [pyTesseractTrainer](https://github.com/BackupGGCode/pytesseracttrainer/), but it uses a different way to display the boxes, so it isn't so resource intensive.
